A Natural Language Processing project for classifying fake news articles using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

## Description

The "Fake News Classification with LSTM" project is focused on building model that can classify news articles as either real or fake. It leverages LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to handle sequential data and make accurate predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and text cleaning
- Stemming
- Vacab_Size
- One hot Representation
- Embedding Representation
- Model Selection
- Model Training
- Model Fit
- Accuracy

## Installation

   ```bash
   pip install -r reqirements.txt
